## Features

- **System Monitoring**: Displays real-time battery status, device info, and network details.
- **Interactive Graphs**: Visualize CPU usage and other metrics with charts using `react-native-chart-kit`.
- **Hacker-Themed UI**: Dark theme with green text, inspired by terminal aesthetics of Kali Linux.
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and animations using `react-native-reanimated`.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes for optimal viewing on different devices.
